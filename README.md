# c-projects
this repository holds some c projects

## dungeon.X
this file holds a dungeon game made in C. The room files are not something I made but I made the code that uses them. The code
takes the .txt files and using file IO manipulates them and makes a game for the user to navigate different scenarios. Following 
map around picking up different items and dropping them aswell.

## RPNCalculator.X
this file holds an RPN calculator. The user can enter a string of text with different types of characters and the solution to the 
problem will be produced. "1+22*5" is an example of what can be entered.
