## comments
This pa took longer than the other ones as it was more complicated. I don't think i got the implementaion of
each fucntion down correctly so i may lose points. Most of the implementation for the fucntions
I got from going to tutoring sections as well as from the example files. For arithmetic I used the example
files for help and implemantaion. The same foes for the Biginteger.cpp file. the .h file for Bitinteger
was provided and the test were just something i cam up with. The List files were all from the previous pa.
The make file was provided as well.
